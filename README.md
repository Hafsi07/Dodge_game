# Dodge_game
 python dodge game: 
 I developed this game using pygame module in python, and designed the interface of the main menu also the background of the game using photoshop. 
 All you have to do is control the spaceship with the keyboard arrows and dodge the red TURDS knowing that if you go all  the way up to the border of the window you spawn back at the bottom of it, you can see up right in the main menu the highest score and try to beat it, the game gets faster by time so you have to be quicker too.
 The code comments quite explain how it works, so feel free to check it out.
